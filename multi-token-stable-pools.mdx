title: "Multi-Token Stable Pools"
description: "We developed Solanaâ€™s first multi-token stable vault under Mercurial, allowing for very efficient pooling of liquidity with multiple assets in a single pool. We were also the first to solve several key technical problems, including optimizing the stable algorithm for compute units to fit into the limitations of Solana."

We also developed DeFi's first non-pegged stable pools by leveraging an innovative mechanism that leverages on-chain oracles to maintain capital efficiency between 2 tokens in the pool, even as the value of one of the tokens increases over time.

Over the past year, these pools are now leading providers of stable liquidity in Solana, anchoring key pairs like allBridge, wormhole, stSOL with the native Solana and USDC tokens.
