title: "Introduction"
description: "Previously, Meteora developed the most dynamic protocols in DeFi by leveraging the power of Solana. These include dynamic vaults, which rebalance every minute across 10 lending protocols in search of safe, optimum yield, as well as dynamic AMMs tailored for a variety of use cases, including LM-free LST markets, forex, stablecoins, and more."

After intense development, collaboration with the ecosystem, and weekly community calls for over a year, we are delighted to announce the most comprehensive plan to drive liquidity and TVL for Solana ever conceived — the Meteora Stimulus Package!

The Massive Meteora Stimulus Package involves:

1. **DLMM**: A new dynamic liquidity market maker with dynamic fees and precise liquidity concentration for the best LPing possible

   - LPs can now access dynamic fees and precise liquidity concentration
   - For LPs, this allows greater fee capture during market swings and opens up all-new AMM LP strategies
   - For projects, new creative ways to launch your token with more flexible token designs

2. **Expert DAO**: An expert DAO with the best DeFi minds in Solana

   - To leverage experts to guide the DAO on its mission - To empower LPs to align the DAO with its core userbase
   - To promote transparency and confidence in MET

3. [**10% LP Stimulus Proposal**](https://proposals.meteora.ag/t/10-lp-stimulus-plan/9): A proposal for 10% of MET to be set aside for LPs to massively encourage TVL growth in Solana in early 2024

   - 10% of MET to be allocated to LPs before the token is liquid
   - LPs as stakeholders will ensure we continue to build the right things for our users
   - This stimulus will bring Meteora to a great start at the point of token liquidity, creating TVL and volume, decentralizing the DAO with the right stakeholders, and creating inflow not only from Solana, but, from elsewhere as well

This strategy encompasses the concurrent execution of a novel product, a dedicated community, and a robust incentive structure. Close collaboration with all key stakeholders is essential to bring this vision to fruition, and we look forward to working with everyone towards making Solana the best trading ecosystem in crypto!

## Sequence Of Events

We believe that the combination of this 3 aspects — **product, community, incentives** will be the key to a holistic plan that will supercharge Solana TVL in 2024 and beyond.

We expect the timeline to be as follows:

* Early Dec: DLMM capped beta, MET dao formation, proposal discussions

* Mid Dec: Open beta, MET DAO proposal voting for community and LPs

* 1st Jan 2024: MET stimulus package for LP starts

* TBD: MET liquidity event.

With LPs to represent our user base, community as our base for DAO governance, and projects representing the needs for new token liquidity, Meteora will have a strong diverse base that will balance all the considerations necessary to grow long-lasting sustainable liquidity for Solana.

Let’s go!
