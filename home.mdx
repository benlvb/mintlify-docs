## Product Overview

Meteora leverages sustainable and efficient DeFi products to enhance liquidity on the Solana network:

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="DLMM Pools" href="/dlmm/dlmm-overview" icon="square-1" iconType="solid">
    DLMM (Dynamic Liquidity Market Maker) gives LPs access to dynamic fees to capitalize on volatility, and precise liquidity concentration all in real-time, with the flexibility to select their preferred volatility strategy.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Dynamic AMM Pools" href="/dynamic-pool/dynamic-amm-pools" icon="square-2" iconType="solid">
    Constant product AMM that supports token prices from 0 to infinity. LPs can earn additional yield by utilizing lending sources alongside traditional swap fees, enhancing their returns.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Memecoin Pools" href="/for-memecoins/dynamic-memecoin-pools" icon="square-3" iconType="solid">
    A subset of Dynamic AMM Pools designed to support memecoin launches and liquidity. Liquidity you add during pool creation will be permanently locked forever to help raise community confidence, but you can still earn fees on your locked liquidity.
  </Card>
  <Card title="M3M3 Pools" href="/for-memecoins/m3m3-pools" icon="square-4" iconType="solid">
    Pools with a stake-to-earn mechanism that allows top token stakers to earn swap fees from locked liquidity.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Meteora Launch Pools" href="/meteora-launch-pool/meteora-launch-pool-overview" icon="square-5" iconType="solid">
    Specially-designed DLMM for new token launches. It comes fundamentally equipped with a feature set that makes it optimal for bootstrapping liquidity for new tokens and making the tokens accessible on Jupiter and other trading integrations.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Dynamic Vaults" href="/dynamic-vault-integration/dynamic-vaults" icon="square-6" iconType="solid">
    Dynamic Vaults optimize capital utilization by dynamically distributing assets to lending pools, generating yields for liquidity providers (LPs) on Dynamic AMM and Memecoin Pools.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Non-Pegged Stable Pools" icon="square-7" iconType="solid">
    Tailored for non-pegged assets, these pools maintain the pegged value of assets within the pool, promoting maximum capital efficiency.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Multi-token Stable Pools" icon="square-8" iconType="solid">
    These pools efficiently combine liquidity from multiple assets into a single pool, enabling LPs to diversify their holdings and optimize capital utilization.
  </Card>

By implementing these innovative liquidity solutions, Meteora aims to foster a thriving ecosystem on Solana and establish Solana as the ultimate trading hub in DeFi.

## Solana as DeFi's trading hub

Solana is best positioned to become the preferred trading hub in DeFi due to its speed, low fees, and scalability. It runs on a single state machine, which means that it is not fragmented between many L2 systems. This allows liquidity and systems built on top of Solana to work seamlessly together.

Currently, Solana's lack of liquidity poses a significant obstacle to user adoption and growth. Meteora aims to address this challenge and drive substantial liquidity to Solana, fostering its widespread adoption and robust growth.

## Why Liquidity on Solana is Important

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="Facilitating Essential Functions" icon="square-1" iconType="solid">
    Deep liquidity for key tokens like SOL enables smooth liquidation and minimizes bad debt risks within the ecosystem.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Attracting Users from Other Chains" icon="square-2" iconType="solid">
    Deep liquidity for wrapped tokens (e.g., BTC, ETH, ARB) on Solana allows users to bridge assets across chains, attracting users from other blockchain networks.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Boosting Trading Activity" icon="square-3" iconType="solid">
    Introducing new ecosystem tokens like Bonk enhances trading options, stimulating activity and liquidity on Solana.

### Meteora's Approach to Driving Liquidity to Solana

We are taking a multi-pronged approach to driving liquidity to Solana.
<Frame>
  <img src="/images/home-1.png" alt="Meteora's Approach to Driving Liquidity to Solana" />
</Frame>

Firstly, we are focused on constructing sustainable and efficient DeFi protocols that will facilitate long-term liquidity.

Secondly, we will establish a decentralized, transparent, and trusted system, underpinned by a supportive community.

Lastly, we are forging partnerships with long-term liquidity providers (LPs) who are motivated to contribute liquidity to Meteora and Solana in both the immediate and long term.

## Upcoming Steps

The following section outlines the important next steps to bring us towards our goal of making Solana liquid again.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Kickstart: Establishing DAO and Governance">

  In this phase, we will establish the DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) and governance system for Meteora. Additionally, we will release the locked MET token to our initial stakeholders, who are the supportive Mercurial token holders. These stakeholders have been instrumental in shaping our strategy and plans and we want them to play an important role in the next phase of Meteora where they can vote for important decisions like our token plan as well as pool emissions. This phase is important to help make our project decentralized and transparent - key principals to building trust for attracting liquidity and partner projects to build on top of our systems.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Bootstrap: Incentivizing Partners and LPs">

  Working alongside the DAO, we will design incentive systems to encourage partners and liquidity providers (LPs) to contribute initial and long-term liquidity on Meteora and Solana. For example, partners providing initial liquidity will have the opportunity to acquire a stake in Meteora through locked MET tokens.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Sustain: Researching Sustainable Liquidity Systems">

  We will continue researching and building sustainable liquidity systems such that even after the initial common liquidity mining incentive stage is over, there are other forms of incentives to attract and sustain liquidity.

  Our focus includes exploring Concentrated Liquidity and Market Making (CLMM) pools, which enhance price discovery, reduce slippage for traders and enable yield with fewer tokens deposited.

  These efforts ensure ongoing liquidity and support the long-term success of Meteora and Solana.
