 There are factors that affect allocation in a platform:

* APY

* Total deposit

* Deposit limit

* Pool utilization rates

* Pool reserve levels

Rebalance cranks are sent every few minutes, so user will get yield just after few minutes depositing in vault

<Info>
  *Keeper can only deposit in predefined strategies, and cannot claim tokens.*
