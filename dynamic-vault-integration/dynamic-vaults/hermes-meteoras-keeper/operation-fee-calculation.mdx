title: "Operation fee calculation"
description: "When an operator submits tx deposit_strategy or withdraw_strategy (when assets are rebalanced between lending protocols), we call this the rebalance crank."

Fee is collected to the [fee\_vault](https://solscan.io/account/9kZeN47U2dubGbbzMrzzoRAUvpuxVLRcjW9XiFpYjUo4#splTransfers) every time the operator sends a rebalance crank. This fee is shown in the fee\_vault address as vault LP SPL tokens.

We are currently charging 5% of profit as the operation (performance) fee. Before jumping into the formula, we define some variables:

Before rebalance:

* vault.total\_amount : t1

* lp\_mint.total\_supply: p1

* virtual\_price (value of lp token): v1 =t1/p1

After rebalance:

* vault.total\_amount : t2

* lp\_mint.total\_supply: p1

* virtual\_price: v2 =t2/p1

We charge operation fee:

$$
\text{fee} = 0.05 \times (t_2 - t_1)
$$

Virtual price after fee:

$$
v_21 = (t_2 - \text{fee}) / p_1
$$

Vault doesn't send the token directly to the treasury token account (because vault may not have enough liquidity), so vault mint more lp tokens for fee\_vault. Assuming vault mints more **delta** lp tokens, then the new virtual price:

$$
v_22 = t_2 / (p_1 + \text{delta})
$$

We still ensure the virtual price in (1) and (2) are the same v21=v22, so

$$
(t_2 - \text{fee}) / p_1 = t_2 / (p_1 + \text{delta})
$$

Then we can calculate how many lp tokens is minted more for each rebalance crank:

$$
\text{delta} = (p_1 \times \text{fee}) / (t_2 - \text{fee})
$$

Or

$$
\text{delta} = p_1 \times (t_2 - t_1) / (9 \times t_2 + t_1)
$$
