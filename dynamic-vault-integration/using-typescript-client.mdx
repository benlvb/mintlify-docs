title: "Using Typescript-Client"
description: "Mercurial Vault SDK is a typescript library that allows you to interact with Mercurial's dynamic vaults."
---

The typescript client provides an easy way to integrate and interact with our Mercurial Dynamic Vaults. With the integration, your users can deposit and withdraw tokens from the vaults and receive the yield generated by the lending pools. You can also display key information regarding the vaults like total LP supply, total liquidity and APY etc. You can follow the simple guide below to get started.

Alternatively, you can also refer to and git clone the demo repos (react or node) to get started. The example demo includes all functionality and information we display on our own site.

<Info>
If you are an affiliate partner, you are required to pass in your partner address in step 5 (in guide) when you initialize the vault instance. This is to allow our system to track the referral fees generated due to the liquidity provided by your users. To become an affiliate partner, you can contact us via our discord.

### Quick Start Guide

<Steps>
    <Step title="Install Mercurial Vaults Dependencies">

    ```typescript
    npm i @mercurial-finance/vault-sdk @project-serum/anchor @solana/web3.js @solana/spl-token @solana/spl-token-registry
    ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Import the needed libraries">

    ```typescript
    import { StaticTokenListResolutionStrategy, TokenInfo } from "@solana/spl-token-registry";
    import { AnchorProvider } from '@project-serum/anchor';
    import VaultImpl from '@mercurial-finance/vault-sdk';
    import { BN } from 'bn.js';
    ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Set up the connection, wallet and provider necessary to interact with the network">

    Set up the devnet connection

    ```typescript
    const devnetConnection = new Connection('https://api.devnet.solana.com/', { commitment: 'confirmed' });
    ```

    Set up your mock wallet. We will be using the devnet wallet address for this demo

    ```typescript
    const mockWallet = new Wallet(new Keypair());
    ```

    Finally, set up the Provider using the devnetConnection and mock wallet object

    ```typescript
    const provider = new AnchorProvider(devnetConnection, mockWallet, {
        commitment: 'confirmed',
    });
    ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Airdrop SOL into the devnet wallet">

    As this demo will be done using a devnet wallet, we can use the Solana airdrop function to deposit some initial SOL into the wallet.

    Define the SOL airdrop function as shown below. We have already included this function in the util.ts file for easy access and use.

    ```typescript
    const airDropSol = async (connection: Connection, publicKey: PublicKey, amount = 1 * LAMPORTS_PER_SOL) => {
        try {
            const airdropSignature = await connection.requestAirdrop(
                publicKey,
                amount,
            );
            const latestBlockHash = await connection.getLatestBlockhash();
            await connection.confirmTransaction({
                blockhash: latestBlockHash.blockhash,
                lastValidBlockHeight: latestBlockHash.lastValidBlockHeight,
                signature: airdropSignature,
            });
        } catch (error) {
            console.error(error);
            throw error;
        }
    };
    ```

    To trigger the airdrop to your devnet wallet, simply call the function with devnetConnection and your mockWallet public key as input parameters.

    ```typescript
    // Airdrop to devnet wallet
    await airDropSol(devnetConnection, mockWallet.publicKey);
    ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Initialize the Vault">

    Retrieve the token info required to initialize the vault instance. We use the SOL token as an example here.

    ```typescript
    // Retrieve the token info for the vault (example: SOL)
    const tokenMap = new StaticTokenListResolutionStrategy().resolve();
    const SOL_TOKEN_INFO = tokenMap.find(token => token.symbol === 'SOL') as TokenInfo;
    ```

    Set up the vault instance using the connection and the token info

    ```typescript
    // Getting a Vault Implementation instance (SOL)
    const vault: VaultImpl = await VaultImpl.create(
        devnetConnection,
        SOL_TOKEN_INFO,
        {
            cluster: 'devnet'
        }
    );
    ```

    If you are an affiliate partner, you have to pass in an additional parameter - `affiliateId` when setting up the vault instance. The `affiliateId` is the partner wallet address that was used to set up the affiliate relationship with the Mercurial Dynamic Yield layer.

    ```typescript
    // Getting a Vault Implementation instance (SOL)
    const vaultImpl: VaultImpl = await VaultImpl.create(
        devnetConnection,
        SOL_TOKEN_INFO,
        {
            cluster: 'devnet',
            // Replace with your own Partner ID!
            affiliateId: new PublicKey('7236FoaWTXJyzbfFPZcrzg3tBpPhGiTgXsGWvjwrYfiF')
        }
    );
    ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Get key data from the vault instance">

    Retrieve on-chain data from the vault and off-chain APY data from API. Key info includes total amount currently unlocked for user withdrawals, virtual price and the various strategies connected to the vault. The code for this can be found in *getVaultDetails.ts*

    ```typescript
    // Get on-chain data from the vault and off-chain data from the api
export const getVaultDetails = async (vaultImpl: VaultImpl) => {
    //Get the total unlocked amount in vault that is withdrawable by users
    const vaultUnlockedAmount = (await vaultImpl.getWithdrawableAmount()).toNumber();
    //Calculate virtual price using the vault's unlocked amount and lp supply
    const virtualPrice = (vaultUnlockedAmount / vaultImpl.lpSupply.toNumber()) || 0;

    // Get the off-chain data from API
    const URL = KEEPER_URL['devnet'];
    const vaultStateAPI: VaultStateAPI = await (await fetch(`${URL}/vault_state/${SOL_TOKEN_INFO.address}`)).json();
    const totalAllocation = vaultStateAPI.strategies.reduce((acc, item) => acc + item.liquidity, vaultStateAPI.token_amount)

    return {
        lpSupply: (await vaultImpl.getVaultSupply()).toString(),
        withdrawableAmount: vaultUnlockedAmount,
        virtualPrice,
        usd_rate: vaultStateAPI.usd_rate,
        closest_apy: vaultStateAPI.closest_apy, // 1 hour average APY
        average_apy: vaultStateAPI.average_apy, // 24 hour average APY
        long_apy: vaultStateAPI.long_apy, // 7 day average APY
        earned_amount: vaultStateAPI.earned_amount, // total fees earned by vault
        virtual_price: vaultStateAPI.virtual_price,
        total_amount: vaultStateAPI.total_amount,
        total_amount_with_profit: vaultStateAPI.total_amount_with_profit,
        token_amount: vaultStateAPI.token_amount,
        fee_amount: vaultStateAPI.fee_amount,
        lp_supply: vaultStateAPI.lp_supply,
        strategyAllocation: vaultStateAPI.strategies
            .map(item => ({
                name: item.strategy_name,
                liquidity: item.liquidity,
                allocation: ((item.liquidity / totalAllocation) * 100).toFixed(0),
                maxAllocation: item.max_allocation,
            }))
            .concat({
                name: 'Vault Reserves',
                liquidity: vaultStateAPI.token_amount,
                allocation: ((vaultStateAPI.token_amount / totalAllocation) * 100).toFixed(0),
                maxAllocation: 0,
            })
            .sort((a, b) => b.liquidity - a.liquidity),
    }
}
```

You can trigger the function and get the vault details via the following:

    ```typescript
    const vaultDetails = await getVaultDetails(vault);
    console.log(vaultDetails);
    ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="To deposit tokens into the vault">

    The steps below will allow you to deposit tokens into the vault by specifying the source wallet and the amount you want to deposit.

    ```typescript
    // Deposits into the vault
    const depositAmount = 0.1;
    const depositTx = await vault.deposit(mockWallet.publicKey, new BN(depositAmount * 10 ** SOL_TOKEN_INFO.decimals)); // 0.1 SOL
    const depositResult = await provider.sendAndConfirm(depositTx);
    ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="To withdraw tokens from the vault">

    The steps below will allow you to withdraw tokens from the vault by specifying the destination wallet and the amount you want to withdraw from the vault.

    ```typescript
    // Withdraw from the vault
    const withdrawAmount = 0.05;
    const withdrawTx = await vault.withdraw(mockWallet.publicKey, new BN(withdrawAmount * 10 ** SOL_TOKEN_INFO.decimals)); // 0.05 SOL
    const withdrawResult = await provider.sendAndConfirm(withdrawTx); // Transaction hash
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Retrieve affiliate partner info (only if you are set up as an affiliate partner)">

    If you are an affiliate partner, you can retrieve information about the partner account.

    ```typescript
const partnerInfo = await vaultImpl.getAffiliateInfo();
console.log('Result:', {
        'publicKey': mockWallet.publicKey.toString(),
        'balance': (await vaultImpl.getUserBalance(mockWallet.publicKey)).toString(),
        'Partner Token': partnerInfo.partnerToken.toString(),
        'Vault': partnerInfo.vault.toString(),
        'Total Fee': partnerInfo.totalFee.toString(),
        'Fee Ratio': partnerInfo.feeRatio.toString(),
        'Cumulative Fee': partnerInfo.cummulativeFee.toString(),
    })
    ```
    </Step>
</Steps>
