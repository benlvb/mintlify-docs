Having a trusted capital allocation layer is important to help allocate liquidity to where it is needed the most, while mitigating risks that come along when depositing to these lending protocols. By providing a trusted and optimized way for users to participate in DeFi lending, we will inadvertently attract more capital and participants to the ecosystem, driving innovation, and growth.

The vaults prioritize safety by monitoring utilization rates and reserve levels, and withdrawing funds if thresholds are reached. To ensure secure yields, we have maximum allocation measures based on factors like audit, open-source code, and insurance coverage of lending platforms. These measures will be consistently refined with the community.
