title: "Can I Create an LST, FX, or Multi-token Pool Using the Dynamic Pool Creation Tool?"
description: "No. LST, FX, and Multi-token pools are currently permissioned as they need to be specially configured. The team creates them on a case by case basis."

**For LST pools:** You cannot create an LST pool using the standard dynamic (stable) pool creation process. The team needs to input certain unique parameters for the pool since the LST price changes based on staking yield. The pool needs to have a stable curve + support the reading of price from the stake account to always have a pegged price. For now, a DLMM pool (Bin Step 1, Base fee 0.01%) might be more suitable for your LST pair than a dynamic pool. For example, this [bSOL-SOL pool](https://app.meteora.ag/dlmm/3q4KmkMmzatUwvBs15Pdn2PR1X6h8GvuoXF5T9cPejqF) or [JitoSOL-SOL pool](https://app.meteora.ag/dlmm/BoeMUkCLHchTD31HdXsbDExuZZfcUppSLpYtV3LZTH6U)

**For FX pools:** You cannot create an FX pool using the dynamic (stable) pool creation process, as the team needs to estimate and input an AMP for the pool based on historical exchange rate. A DLMM pool might be more suitable for your FX pair than a dynamic pool.
