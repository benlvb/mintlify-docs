title: "How to Track Your Earnings for a Dynamic Pool?"

When you add liquidity into a Dynamic AMM pool, you receive an LP token that represents your liquidity position and share of the pool. Fees generated are added back to the pool and compounded, growing the pool, and your LP tokens are your share of the pool.

The quantity of your LP tokens will not increase. If the value of the pool grows, your LP tokens increase in value but they do not increase in quantity. When you withdraw your liquidity from the pool, you get your liquidity + fees earned.

Here's a way to track your earnings:

1. After you deposit into a pool, go to the Withdraw tab, click max withdraw and record how many assets you will get back along with the exchange rate. It is also helpful to record the price/exchange rate between the two tokens at the time of the deposit.

2. Anytime you want to check your earnings, go to the Withdraw tab repeat the steps above.

**Important notes about LPing**

* When you LP, you are offering up your assets so traders can swap back and forth. You will not get back the same ratio of assets unless you withdraw at the same price as when you deposited in the pool. As long as both assets do not decline/rise in value from the time you deposit, you should get the same total value + fees when you withdraw as when you deposited.

* With Dynamic Pools the fee earnings are compounding in the pool and are not separate from your deposits. So when you withdraw, you are withdrawing your liquidity + fees earned.

* When you deposit, you get an LP tokens that represent your share of liquidity in the Dynamic Pool. The number of LP tokens doesn't change unless you deposit or withdraw from the pool.

* The exchange rate in the withdraw screen is the value of 1 LP token in USD. You can use this to also track how much you've earned by subtracting the difference at the time of your deposit and multiply by how many LP tokens you have.
