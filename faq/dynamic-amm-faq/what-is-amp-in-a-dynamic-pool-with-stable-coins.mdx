title: "What is AMP in a Dynamic Pool with Stable Coins?"
description: "The AMP (amplification) factor controls how concentrated the liquidity is in the stable pool, which relates to how far the ratio of 1:1 the assets will go before it starts to charge more for trades that further unbalance the ratio and charge less for trades that move the ratio of assets back to 1:1."
