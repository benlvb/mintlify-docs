title: "How Do I See Fees Earned on a Dynamic AMM Pool?"

When you add liquidity into a Dynamic AMM pool, you receive an LP token that represents your liquidity position and share of the pool. Fees generated are added back to the pool and compounding, growing the pool, and your LP tokens are your share of the pool.

Your deposited assets in the pool are used by traders and will be swapped back and forth. You will not get back the same ratio of assets unless you withdraw at the same price as when you deposited in the pool.

The quantity of your LP tokens will not increase. If the value of the pool grows, your LP tokens increase in value but they do not increase in quantity.

When you withdraw your liquidity from the pool, you get your liquidity + fees earned. As long as both assets do not decline/rise in value from the time you deposit, you should get the same original total value + fees when you withdraw as when you deposited.

To track earnings, please take a look at the following steps:

1. After you deposit into a pool, go to the withdraw tab, click max withdraw and record how many assets you will get back along with the exchange rate. It is also helpful to record the price/exchange rate between the two tokens at the time of the deposit.

2. The exchange rate in the withdraw screen is the value of 1 LP token in USD. You can use this to also track how much you've earned by subtracting the difference at the time of your deposit and multiply by how many LP tokens you have.

3. Anytime you want to check your earnings, go to the withdraw tab repeat the steps above.

<Info>
  If you had perma-locked your liquidity in the pool, you would be able to claim fees from your perma-lock liquidity on the UI, even if you no longer have access to the liquidity.
