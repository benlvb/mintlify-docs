### What is SOL?

SOL is the Solana blockchainâ€™s native cryptocurrency which is required for transaction fees and other use cases such as securing the network via staking.

### Transaction fees on Solana

Transaction fees on the Solana blockchain use SOL, which means as a user you must have SOL in your wallet whenever you want to initiate any type of on-chain action.

When you add or remove liquidity on Meteora, whether this involves the DLMM, Dynamic Vaults, or Multi-token pools, you'd need SOL for transaction fees.

Note: 0.000000001 SOL = 1 lamport (one-billionth of a SOL)
