1. **Jupiter Terminal**

   Meteora has integrated Jupiter - the most popular DEX aggregator - to help you swap at the best rates. This is done through Jupiter Terminal, which is an open-sourced, lite version of Jupiter that provides end-to-end swap flow by linking it in a site's HTML.

   When you are navigating through Meteora, you can access Jupiter Terminal by selecting the Jupiter Terminal icon at the bottom left of the screen. You will see a pop-up where you can connect your wallet (this connects automatically if you're connected on Meteora), select your input and output tokens, and execute your swap.

2. **Swapping within the pool**

   When you already possess one of the tokens in an asset pair for a pool, you can also swap some amounts of that token to the other directly using the existing pool liquidity.

   For example, if you want to add liquidity to a SOL/USDC pool, but you only have SOL, you can simply select the "Swap" tab on the pool page to swap a portion your total SOL to an equivalent value of USDC (based on the current pool price of the token). Before you swap through that specific pool, please check that the pool has sufficient liquidity and the current pool price of the token is in sync with the market price. In addition, check that you are comfortable with the settings (e.g. fees, your preferred slippage) of that pool.
