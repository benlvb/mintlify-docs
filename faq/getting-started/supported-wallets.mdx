title: "Supported Wallets"
description: "A Solana-compatible wallet is a must-have digital tool for you to receive, send, store, and manage your cryptocurrencies or non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Solana blockchain. Just like using any other decentralized application (Dapp) on Solana, you will need to first connect your wallet on Meteora in order to add liquidity to a pool or execute other transactions."
