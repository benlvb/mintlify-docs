title: "What is Wrapped SOL?"
description: "Currently, Dapps have to wrap and unwrap SOL when trading in SOL or using SOL in DeFi due to the fact that native SOL itself is not an SPL token (e.g. JUP)."

If there is unused wSOL from adding liquidity or if you're withdrawing wSOL from a pool, you can unwrap it to get it back to native SOL.
