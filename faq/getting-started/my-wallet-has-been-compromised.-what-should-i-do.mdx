title: "My Wallet Has Been Compromised. What Should I Do?"
description: "Unfortunately, if your wallet has been compromised, the best approach would be to transfer your assets to a new wallet immediately and LP with the new wallet."

Please always be wary of scams, phishing links, and downloading any programs. Team members would never dm you directly or ask you to join another discord. NEVER give or show your walletâ€™s private key to anyone.

For any points, airdrop, or rewards system, it would be extremely challenging to verify the original owner of the compromised wallet once multiple malicious parties have access to it.
