title: "Terms of Service"
description: 'Meteora is a distributed set of specially-developed smart contracts (each, a "Smart Contract") deployed on the Solana blockchain or such other compatible blockchain network, as the case may be (each, the "relevant Blockchain Network") which allows any user to trade digital asset pairs directly in a peer-to-peer manner via Liquidity Pools (as defined herein).'
---

The Dynamic Liquidity Market Maker (DLMM) Smart Contracts underlying Meteora offer a variety of innovations to decentralised exchanges, for example high capital efficiency (supporting high volume trading with low liquidity requirements through the concentrating of tokens at or around the current market value), zero slippage (swap tokens with zero slippage or price impact within active bin), dynamic fees (liquidity providers earn dynamic swap fees during high market volatility to compensate for impermanent loss) and flexible liquidity (liquidity providers can build Liquidity Pools with flexible liquidity distributions according to their volatility strategies, e.g. single-sided liquidity with only one token).

The Liquidity Pools and Meteora may be visualised on a user interface that the user can interact with, including but not limited to the website at https\://www\.meteora.ag/ and each of their subdomains, or our mobile or web applications (the "Site"). The Smart Contracts and the Site are collectively referred to in these Terms as (the "App"). Using the App, users can interact with the underlying Smart Contracts to create Liquidity Pools, view their Liquidity Pools created or accessed, and interact with other users in Meteora ecosystem.

The Company's sole role is the deployment of the Smart Contracts, and accordingly any interaction with Liquidity Pools take place solely on the relevant Blockchain Network. It is important that you understand that smart contract protocols such as Meteora simply comprise a set of autonomous blockchain-based smart contracts deployed on the relevant Blockchain Network, operated directly by users calling functions on it (which allows them to interact with other users in a multi-party peer-to-peer manner). There is no further control by or interaction with the original entity which had deployed the smart contract (i.e. the Company), which entity solely functions as a provider of technical tools for users, and is not offering any sort of securities product or regulated service nor does it hold any user assets on custody. Any rewards earned by user interactions arise solely out of their involvement in the protocol by taking on the risk of interacting with other users and the ecosystem.

Dynamic Labs Limited (the "Company", "we", "our" or "us") is making the App available to you. Before you use the App, the Smart Contracts, or the Site, however, you will need to agree to these Terms of Use and any terms and conditions incorporated herein by reference (collectively, these "Terms"). PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE APP, THE SMART CONTRACTS, OR THE SITE. THESE TERMS GOVERN YOUR USE OF THE APP, THE SMART CONTRACTS, AND THE SITE, UNLESS WE HAVE EXECUTED A SEPARATE WRITTEN AGREEMENT WITH YOU FOR THAT PURPOSE. WE ARE ONLY WILLING TO MAKE THE APP, THE SMART CONTRACTS, AND THE SITE AVAILABLE TO YOU IF YOU ACCEPT ALL OF THESE TERMS. BY USING THE APP, THE SMART CONTRACTS, THE SITE, OR ANY PART OF THEM, OR BY CLICKING "I ACCEPT" BELOW OR INDICATING YOUR ACCEPTANCE IN AN ADJOINING BOX, YOU ARE CONFIRMING THAT YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY ALL OF THESE TERMS. IF YOU ARE ACCEPTING THESE TERMS ON BEHALF OF A COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU HAVE THE LEGAL AUTHORITY TO ACCEPT THESE TERMS ON THAT ENTITY’S BEHALF, IN WHICH CASE "YOU" WILL MEAN THAT ENTITY. IF YOU DO NOT HAVE SUCH AUTHORITY, OR IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT ALL OF THESE TERMS, THEN WE ARE UNWILLING TO MAKE THE APP, THE SMART CONTRACTS, OR THE SITE AVAILABLE TO YOU. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR USE THE APP, THE SMART CONTRACTS, OR THE SITE.

Supplemental terms and conditions or documents that may be posted on the App from time to time are hereby expressly incorporated herein by reference. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to make changes to the Terms from time to time. We will alert you of any changes by updating the “Last Updated" date of these Terms (on the first page hereof), and you waive any right to receive specific notice of each such change. It is your responsibility to periodically review these Terms to stay informed of updates.

If you are a Restricted Person, then do not attempt to access or use the App, the Smart Contracts, the Site or the Services. Use of a virtual private network (e.g., a VPN) or other means by Restricted Persons to access or use the App, the Smart Contracts, the Site or the Services is prohibited. For the purpose of these Terms, Restricted Territory shall mean the British Virgin Islands, the United States, China, Myanmar (Burma), Cote D'Ivoire (Ivory Coast), Cuba, Crimea and Sevastopol, Democratic Republic of Congo, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Mali, Nicaragua, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (North Korea), Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Yemen, Zimbabwe, Russia, or any other state, country or region that is subject to sanctions enforced by the United States or the European Union.

   b. The App, the Smart Contracts, the Site or the Services made available through the App (or any portion thereof) may not be available to all users, and we reserve the right to assess or reassess at any time your eligibility to use all or part of the App, the Smart Contracts, the Site or the Services.

The App, the Smart Contracts, the Site and the Services does not constitute, and may not be used for the purposes of, an offer or solicitation to anyone in any jurisdiction in which such offer or solicitation is not authorised, or to any person to whom it is unlawful to make such an offer or solicitation.

   d. Without limiting the foregoing, by using the App, the Smart Contracts, the Site or the Services, you acknowledge and understand that laws regarding digital assets, cryptocurrency derivatives, financial instruments, or investment products which may include digital assets, may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and it is your sole obligation to ensure that you fully comply with any law, regulation or directive, relevant to your jurisdiction with regard to the use of the App, the Smart Contracts, the Site or the Services. For the avoidance of doubt, the ability to access the App, the Smart Contracts, the Site or the Services does not necessarily mean that same (or your activities through it) are legal under the laws, regulations or directives relevant to your jurisdiction.

2. The App

   a. To most easily access the App, you may first install a web browser (such as the Google Chrome web browser) and an electronic wallet compatible with the relevant Blockchain Network, such as the Phantom or Solflare electronic wallet. These electronic wallet services provide a visual representation allowing you to interact with the relevant Blockchain Network to purchase, store, and engage in transactions with various digital assets. You will not be able to engage in any transactions on the App other than through your selected electronic wallet service, or other browsers compatible with the relevant Blockchain Network.

   b. Transactions that take place via the visual user interface on the App are confirmed via the relevant Blockchain Network. You understand that your public address on the relevant Blockchain Network will be made publicly visible whenever you engage in a transaction on the App.

   c. The visual user interface provided on the Website facilitates your ability to access Meteora. The interface is distinct from the decentralised Meteora network. Meteora is public, permissionless, and runs on open-source self-executing software; while the interface itself merely enables you to initiate messages to Meteora in order to perform functions or access Services thereon. The interface is one of the means of accessing Meteora, but not the exclusive means of access.

   d. Meteora is a non-custodial protocol, therefore the App does not hold or control your digital assets. Any digital assets which you may acquire through the usage of the App will be held and administered solely by you through your selected electronic wallet, and we shall have no access to or responsibility in regard to such electronic wallet or digital asset held therein. It is solely your responsibility to select the wallet service provider to use in connection with the App, and your use of such electronic wallet will be subject to the governing terms of use or privacy policy of the provider of such wallet. We neither own nor control your selected electronic wallet service, Google Chrome, any electronic wallet, the relevant Blockchain Network, or any other third party site, product, or service that you might access, visit, or use for the purpose of enabling you to use the various features of the App. We will not be liable for the acts or omissions of any such third parties, nor will we be liable for any damage that you may suffer as a result of your transactions or any other interaction with any such third parties.

   e. The Company will not create any hosted wallet for you or otherwise custody digital assets on your behalf, and it is your sole responsibility to maintain the security of your selected electronic wallet. In the event that you lose access to your electronic wallet, private key(s), password(s), or other method(s) of securing your wallet, all digital assets held in such wallet may be irretrievable, and the Company will be unable to assist you in any way. You hereby irrevocably waive, release and discharge all claims, whether known or unknown to you, against the Company, its affiliates and their respective shareholders, members, directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives related to your use of any wallet software, associated loss of digital assets, transaction failures, or any other defects that arise in the course of your use of your electronic wallet, including any losses that may obtain as a result of any failure of any Smart Contracts, the Site or the App.

   f. The Company reserves the right to modify, suspend or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, all or any part of the Site or the App with or without notice. You agree that the Company will not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of all or any part of the Site or the App.

   g. The publicly deployed Smart Contracts you interact with are experimental in nature and you should not utilise the Smart Contracts or Liquidity Pools for deployment of any substantial amount of digital assets.

   h. We reserve the right to disable access to the App, the Site or the interface at any time in the event of any breach of the Terms, including without limitation, if we, in our sole discretion, believe that you, at any time, fail to satisfy the eligibility requirements set forth in the Terms. Further, we reserve the right to limit or restrict access to the App or the Site by any person or entity, or within any geographic area or legal jurisdiction, at any time and at our sole discretion. We will not be liable to you for any losses or damages you may suffer as a result of or in connection with the App or the Site being inaccessible to you at any time or for any reason.

3. Services

   a. The Company has deployed the Smart Contracts on the relevant Blockchain Network for users to utilise in accordance with these Terms. Users may directly call the functions of the Smart Contracts directly, or access them via the user interface provided by the App.

   b. Meteora allows users to trade digital asset pairs directly in a peer-to-peer manner. Users will be able to act as market makers or liquidity providers for these transactions by staking/pooling their digital assets into decentralised liquidity pools (Liquidity Pools) to provide the necessary liquidity for transactions by other users. These digital assets may comprise various fungible cryptocurrencies in the market.

   c. Liquidity Pools and the underlying digital asset pairings will be selected and created by liquidity providers, who allow other users to access these Liquidity Pools to conduct trades. Any party may trade and/or become a liquidity provider (LP) for a pool by depositing an equivalent value of each underlying token to the Liquidity Pool in return for pool tokens (LP tokens). All trades conducted via Meteora would be performed in a non-custodial manner and users remain in control of their digital assets. Through allocating different amounts of tokens at diverse price points, project teams are able to build their desired liquidity shape with the DLMM that best fits their liquidity provider (LP) goals.

   d. All interactions between liquidity providers and traders on Meteora operate in a peer-to-peer manner. Liquidity providers and traders on Meteora enter into a direct contractual relationship via the autonomous Smart Contracts and/or other smart contracts deployed by various other third party networks, and therefore liquidity providers wholly assume all responsibility towards the user of the Liquidity Pools. There is no further control by or interaction with the Company (or the relevant affiliate) which had deployed the Smart Contract(s). The Company and its affiliates shall in no circumstances be construed as a party to said peer-to-peer direct contractual relationship, is not liable for performance of obligations thereunder, nor does it bear any financial or commercial risk or provide any warranties or assurances in connection with the same.

   e. The App merely provides a visual user interface allowing users to interact with Liquidity Pools and to access liquidity provided by liquidity providers, and does not act as an agent for any of the users. Although the App is intended to display accurate and timely information regarding Liquidity Pools and possible swaps, the App or relevant tools/information may not always be entirely accurate, complete or current and may also include technical inaccuracies or typographical errors. The pricing information data provided through the App does not represent an offer, a solicitation of an offer, or any advice regarding, or recommendation to enter into, a transaction with the Company or the App. Accordingly, users should verify all information before relying on it, and all decisions based on information contained on the App or tools/information tools are at the sole responsibility of each user. Notwithstanding any of the other provisions in these Terms, any photographs, graphic illustrations, videos, models, charts, designs, or examples on the site are strictly for information purposes only and have no contractual value nor do they form the basis of any contract with the Company.

   f. Neither the Company, the Site nor the App provides any digital asset exchange or portfolio/fund management services in connection with the Liquidity Pools. If you choose to engage in transactions with liquidity providers in Liquidity Pools or any other users, then such decisions and transactions and any consequences flowing therefrom are your sole responsibility. In no event shall the Company, its affiliates or their respective directors or employees be responsible or liable to you or anyone else, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss arising from or relating to any interaction or continued interaction with Liquidity Pools, or reliance on any information provided on the Site or the App (including, without limitation, directly or indirectly resulting from errors in, omissions of or alterations to any such information).

   g. THE APP SOLELY FUNCTIONS AS A VISUAL USER INTERFACE. IN NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL THE COMPANY, THE SMART CONTRACTS, THE SITE OR THE APP BE CONSTRUED AS A DIGITAL ASSET EXCHANGE, BROKER, DEALER, FUND MANAGER, FINANCIAL INSTITUTION, EXCHANGE, CUSTODIAN, ROBO-ADVISOR, INTERMEDIARY, OR CREDITOR. THE SITE DOES FACILITATE OR ARRANGE TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN BUYERS AND SELLERS, INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO ANY TRANSACTIONS THAT OCCUR IN CONNECTION WITH A LIQUIDITY POOL, WHICH TRANSACTIONS OCCUR ON THE RELEVANT BLOCKCHAIN NETWORK. THE COMPANY IS NOT A COUNTERPARTY TO ANY TRANSACTION FACILITATED BY THE SMART CONTRACTS, THE SITE OR THE APP OR FOR ANY USER OF THE SITE. NEITHER THE SMART CONTRACTS, THE SITE OR THE APP PROVIDES FINANCIAL ADVISORY, LEGAL, REGULATORY, OR TAX SERVICES DIRECTLY, INDIRECTLY, IMPLICITLY, OR IN ANY OTHER MANNER, AND YOU SHOULD NOT CONSIDER ANY CONTENT CONTAINED IN THESE TERMS OR OTHERWISE POSTED ON THE SITE TO BE A SUBSTITUTE FOR PROFESSIONAL FINANCIAL, LEGAL, REGULATORY, TAX OR OTHER ADVICE. THE COMPANY DOES NOT SUPPORT OR ENDORSE ANY LIQUIDITY POOL CREATED BY ANY USER OF METEORA, AND EACH SUCH CREATOR IS AN INDEPENDENT AGENT WITH NO EMPLOYMENT OR OTHER CONTRACTUAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE COMPANY.

   h. The Company reserves the right to suspend or terminate access to the Site or the App by any creator of Liquidity Pools or user of Liquidity Pools for any reason whatsoever (including without limitation for a breach of these Terms). You agree that the Company will not be liable to you or to any third party for any suspension or termination of any user.

   i. Access to the Smart Contracts, the App or the Site may become degraded or unavailable during times of significant volatility or volume. This could result in the inability to interact with third-party services for periods of time and may also lead to support response time delays. The Company cannot guarantee that the Smart Contracts, the App or the Site will be available without interruption and neither do we guarantee that requests to interact with third-party services will be successful.

4. Fees and Payment

   a. If you elect to interact with Liquidity Pools, all transactions will be conducted solely through the relevant Blockchain Network. We will have no insight into or control over these payments or transactions, nor do we have the ability to reverse any transactions. With that in mind, we will have no liability to you or to any third party for any claims or damages that may arise as a result of any transactions that you engage in via the App, or using the Smart Contracts, or any other transactions that you conduct via the relevant Blockchain Network.

   b. The relevant Blockchain Network typically requires the payment of a transaction fee (a "Gas Fee") for every transaction that occurs on the relevant Blockchain Network. The Gas Fee funds the network of computers that run the decentralised network. This means that you will need to pay a Gas Fee for each transaction that occurs via the Smart Contracts.

   c. You may be subject to certain additional fees and commissions, including fees imposed by creators of Liquidity Pools for accessing and utilising the Liquidity Pools as notified to you prior to engaging with any digital asset swap or liquidity provision. The Company also reserves the right to levy additional fees for access via the Smart Contracts, the Site or the App in the future. You agree to promptly pay all aforementioned fees and commissions.

   d. Notwithstanding anything in these Terms to the contrary, you will be solely responsible to pay any and all sales, use, value-added and other taxes, duties, and assessments (except taxes on the Company's net income) now or hereafter claimed or imposed by any governmental authority (collectively, "Taxes") associated with your use of the App (including, without limitation, any Taxes that may become payable as the result of your ownership or transfer of digital assets or interaction with any Liquidity Pool, or relating to Meteora).

   b. Using the App and interacting with Liquidity Pools carry financial risk. You acknowledge and agree that you are aware of such risks, including the following: (a) transactions relating to digital assets are very risky, and such digital assets are, by their nature, highly experimental, risky, volatile and generally irreversible. You should not make any transactional decision without first conducting your own research. You are solely and exclusively responsible for determining whether any Liquidity Pool, any transaction, or strategy, or any other product or service in connection with the same is appropriate or suitable for you based on your own objectives and personal and financial situation. You acknowledge and agree that you will access and use the Smart Contracts, the Site and the App and interact with Liquidity Pools at your own risk.

   c. You represent that you have sufficient knowledge, market sophistication, professional advice and experience to make your own evaluation of the merits and risks of any interaction with Liquidity Pools and the underlying digital assets. You accept all consequences of participating in such interactions, including the risk that you may lose access to your digital assets indefinitely. All decisions to interact with Liquidity Pools are made solely by you.

Fluctuations in the price of other digital assets could materially and adversely affect the value of your digital assets held in Liquidity Pools, which may also be subject to significant price volatility. We cannot guarantee that any users interacting with Liquidity Pools will not lose money.

   f. Neither the Smart Contracts, Site, the App or Liquidity Pools hold in custody, store, send, or receive any of your digital assets. This is because your digital assets exist only by virtue of the ownership record maintained on the relevant Blockchain Network. Any transfer of digital assets occurs within the relevant Blockchain Network, and not on the Smart Contracts, Site, the App or Liquidity Pools.

   g. Public blockchain-based transactions (including but not limited to transactions automatically executed by smart contracts) are generally considered irreversible when confirmed. Any transaction that will interact with smart contracts or be recorded on a public blockchain must be recorded with extreme caution.

   h. All smart contracts (including the Smart Contracts) may contain security vulnerabilities, errors, failures, bugs or economic loopholes which may be exploited by third parties, causing you to suffer losses in connection with any digital assets re-deployed by Liquidity Pools. Interaction with these Smart Contracts are entirely at your own responsibility and liability, and the Company is not a party to the Smart Contracts.

   i. No creator of Liquidity Pools will be able to guarantee the future performance of digital assets held in a Liquidity Pool, any specific level of performance, the success of any strategy or your overall results from interacting with Liquidity Pools. When reviewing the information, portfolio, performance, opinions of these creators, do not assume that such party is unbiased, independent or qualified to provide financial information or opinions. Past performance and risk scores have many inherent limitations and are not indicative of future results. No representation or guarantee is being made that any creator of Liquidity Pools will or is likely to achieve gains or losses similar to the past performance. The actual percentage gains or losses experienced by users will vary depending on many factors.

   j. Hackers or other malicious groups or organisations may attempt to interfere with the Smart Contracts, the Site, the App or Liquidity Pools in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, malware attacks, denial of service attacks, consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfing and spoofing, which may result in losses incurred by you. Furthermore, because the relevant Blockchain Network comprises open-source software, there is the risk that the software underlying the Services may contain intentional or unintentional bugs or weaknesses that may negatively affect the Services or the Smart Contracts, or result in the loss of the user’s digital assets, or the loss of the user’s ability to access or control their digital assets. In the event of such a software bug or weakness, there may be no remedy, and users are not guaranteed any remedy, refund or compensation.

   k. Further, when you interact with Liquidity Pools or trade on any blockchain network, you accept that there is the inherent risk of the transaction being vulnerable to automated software programs (MEV bots) deployed by third parties which operate within decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem and exploit blockchain mechanics such as transaction ordering and gas price bidding to gain an advantage over specific users, or automated software programs (sniper bots) which executes trades buys or front-runs orders in respect of digital assets as soon as they are available on centralised or decentralised exchanges, which may be deployed by bad actors in connection with market manipulation or insider trading activities. The Company cannot be responsibility for losses suffered due to any of the foregoing, which are inherent to transactions on open blockchain networks.

   l. The regulatory status of digital assets, and distributed ledger technology is unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions. While every effort has been taken to ensure that the Services, the Site, the App and the Smart Contracts are compliant with local laws, it is difficult to predict how or whether regulatory agencies may apply existing regulation with respect to the same. It is likewise difficult to predict how or whether legislatures or regulatory agencies may implement changes to law and regulation affecting distributed ledger technology and its applications, including the Services, the Site, the App or the Smart Contracts. Regulatory actions could negatively impact the Company in various ways, and thus the Services may not be available in certain areas.

   m. The underlying smart contracts run on a variety of supported blockchain networks, using specially-developed smart contracts. Accordingly, upgrades to the relevant Blockchain Network, a hard fork in the relevant Blockchain Network, re-organisations of blockchain structure or blocks, or a change in how transactions are confirmed on the relevant Blockchain Network may have unintended, adverse effects on the smart contracts built thereon, including the Smart Contracts.

   n. The Site, Services and Smart Contracts may rely on or utilise a variety of external third party services or software, including without limitation decentralised cloud storage services, analytics tools, oracles, hence therefore the Services may be adversely affected by any number of risks related to these third party services/software, which may be compromised in the event of security vulnerabilities, cyberattacks, malicious activity, or technical interruptions.

8. External sites

10. Limitation of liability

   a. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT WE, OUR SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, AND LICENSORS WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES WHICH YOU MAY INCUR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SMART CONTRACTS, THE SITE, THE APP OR LIQUIDITY POOLS, HOWSOEVER CAUSED AND UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY LOSS OF PROFITS (WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY), LOSS OF GOODWILL OR BUSINESS REPUTATION, LOSS OF DATA, COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, OR ANY OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSS, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE APP TO YOU WITHOUT THESE LIMITATIONS.

   d. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, AND SOME JURISDICTIONS ALSO LIMIT DISCLAIMERS OR LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY FOR PERSONAL INJURY FROM CONSUMER PRODUCTS, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO PERSONAL INJURY CLAIMS.
